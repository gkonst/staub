        Attribute
        An attribute is a parameter to an element declared in the DTD. An attribute’s type and value
        range, including a possible default value, are defined in the DTD.
        DTD
        A DTD, or document type definition, is a collection of XML markup declarations that, as a
        collection, defines the legal structure, elements, and attributes that are available for use in a
        document that complies to the DTD.
        Document
        A document is a stream of data that, after being combined with any other streams it
        references, is structured such that it holds information contained within elements that are
        organized as defined in the associated DTD. See Document Conformance [p.9] for more
        information.
        Element
        An element is a document structuring unit declared in the DTD. The element’s content
        model is defined in the DTD, and additional semantics may be defined in the prose
        description of the element.
        Facilities
        Facilities are elements, attributes, and the semantics associated with those elements and
        attributes.
        Implementation
        See User Agent.
        Parsing
        Parsing is the act whereby a document is scanned, and the information contained within the
        document is filtered into the context of the elements in which the information is structured.
        Rendering
        Rendering is the act whereby the information in a document is presented. This presentation
        is done in the form most appropriate to the environment (e.g. aurally, visually, in print).
        User Agent
        A user agent is a system that processes XHTML documents in accordance with this
        specification. See User Agent Conformance [p.11] for more information.
        Validation
        Validation is a process whereby documents are verified against the associated DTD,
        ensuring that the structure, use of elements, and use of attributes are consistent with the
        definitions in the DTD.
        Well-formed
        A document is well-formed when it is structured according to the rules defined in Section 2.1
        of the XML 1.0 Recommendation [XML [p.32] ].
